## twenty-eight.js
### Operation
The program displays one led when the program pick a point, displays another led when the point disapearsw and finally, shows the third led when surrounding points display. This program demonstrates the combination of the leds and leds on the micro bit

## manual-calibration.js
### Operation

This code sets the dryness to 50 and the wetness to 850 and divides the microbit into 5 sections and displays how wet something is filling one row is the driest and filling all rows is the wettest

## auto-calibration.js
### Operation

This program starts by asking the user to take a low reading and a high reading three times to calculate the average lowest and the average highest. Then proceeds like the previous program
